# Google Stock Price Indicator using LSTM Model

## Introduction

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources to build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting Google's stock prices. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series data like stock prices. By training this model on historical stock price data, you can make predictions about future stock prices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for running the provided notebooks)
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` (or `keras`) and `yfinance`.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow yfinance
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayan-11/google-stock-price-indicator.git
cd google-stock-price-indicator
```

2. Download historical Google stock price data. You can use the `yfinance` library to fetch this data:

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol and date range
ticker_symbol = "GOOGL"
start_date = "YYYY-MM-DD"
end_date = "YYYY-MM-DD"

# Fetch historical stock data
data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)
```

3. Prepare the data. The dataset should include columns for features and the target variable (in this case, the stock price). You can use the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data.

4. Train the LSTM model. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (`train_lstm_model.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to build and train an LSTM model for stock price prediction. You can modify the hyperparameters and architecture as needed.

5. Evaluate the model. After training, you should evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.

6. Make predictions. Use the trained LSTM model to make predictions on future stock prices.
